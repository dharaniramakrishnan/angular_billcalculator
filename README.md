# description:
A GIR Calculator (Global Impact Ratio Calculator) is a tool designed to measure and evaluate the global impact or effectiveness of an organization, project, or initiative based on specific key metrics. This calculator helps organizations quantify their contributions and assess their overall influence on targeted areas such as environmental sustainability, social welfare, economic growth, or other impact-driven goals.
# Features:
Impact Data Collection:

Allows users to input relevant data points, such as energy savings, waste reduction, community outreach, economic contributions, or health improvements.
Metrics can vary based on the focus area (e.g., carbon emissions for environmental impact, jobs created for economic impact).
Scoring System:

A unique scoring algorithm is used to calculate the Global Impact Ratio (GIR) by weighting each metric based on its importance or relevance.
The score provides an overall impact rating, allowing organizations to compare their efforts or see how they perform against industry standards.
